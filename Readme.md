# Showing a tooltip to notify a user that an editor mask does not accept a typed character


<p>In this example, a custom editor is created to illustrate how to notify a user that an editor mask does not accept a typed character. A numeric mask is applied to this editor. So, if you type a letter, you will see a corresponding tooltip that notifies that this character is not accepted.</p>
